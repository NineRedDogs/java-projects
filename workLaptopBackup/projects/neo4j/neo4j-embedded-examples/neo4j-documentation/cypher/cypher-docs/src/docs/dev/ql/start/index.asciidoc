[[query-start]]
= START

[abstract]
Find starting points through explicit indexes.

The `START` clause was removed in Cypher 3.2, and the recommendation is to use `MATCH` instead (see <<query-match>>).
However, if the use of explicit indexes is required, a series of <<explicit-indexes-procedures, built-in procedures>> allows these to be managed and used.
These procedures offer the same functionality as the `START` clause.
In addition, queries using these procedures may exhibit superior execution performance over queries using `START` owing to the use of the <<cypher-planner, cost planner>> and newer Cypher 3.2 compiler.

[IMPORTANT]
Using the `START` clause explicitly in a query will cause the query to fall back to using Cypher 3.1.
