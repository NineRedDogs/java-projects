OpenXC Vehicle Interface is a microcontroller with 2 external connections:

   1. to the CAN bus via ODB-II port 
         - CAN bus:
              used to allow communication between the various ECUs in a 
              vehicle. The Engine Control Unit (ECU) is the main one, 
              but others such as transmission, airbags, cruise control, 
              etc will need data from other units.
   2. to the host device via USB (or serial) port
         - passively listens for CAN messages, performs any unit conversion 
           and outputs a generic version to the USB interface
