Hi Martijn,

We just wanted to check back in with you guys to see how things are going. 

Have you had a chance to take a look at the call-flow diagrams we sent over last week ?

We're keen to ensure we have a sensible view on how we need to integrate with iWelcome going forward, particularly in the area of Single Sign-on (SSO).

To that end, I've got a few more questions that we'd like to clear up:

Q1. For SSO, we're exepcting to have to introsppect the access token each time, should we be introspecting the Access and/or ID token ?
 
Q2: With respect to ID tokens, does iWelcome support introspection and revocation of ID tokens.

Q3: When revoking an access token, will the ID token also be invalidated ? and vice versa, if revoke ID token, will the access token be invalidated ?

Given the above questions, does it feel we have a good understanding of the best practices in relation to token management for SSO ?


many thanks for any help you can offer.


regards,
Andy
