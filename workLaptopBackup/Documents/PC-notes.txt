1. set up proxy - internet options > connections > LAN settings

      check 'Proxy Server' and add:

          address: 199.19.250.205
          port   : 80

         - OK to close Proxy settings dialog
      check 'bypass proxy server for local addresses'


2. need to add entries to /etc/hosts - use powershell (run as admin) to add entries

	10.250.43.88    pr-ghub.admiral.uk
	10.250.43.88    assets.pr-ghub.admiral.uk
	10.55.119.67    confluence.admiral.uk
	10.252.11.15    jira.admiral.uk
	10.242.1.10     sts.admiralgroup.co.uk 

3. installed windows subsystem for linux - problem with windows store - so had to get installable and install 
4. Set up Windows Root Cert in Ubuntu:

   a) Extract Windows Root Cert:
     - export root cert from windows
     - startup windows tool certlm
     - Certificates> Trusted Root Certification Authorities>Cloud Services
       Root CA
         - Right click - all tasks export (opens Certificate Export Wizard)
             - Next
             - File format : Base64 encoded X.509 (.CER)
             - Next
             - Browse to This PC > Downloads> 
             - Save as cloud-root.crt
             - Next & Finish
   b) import into ubuntu
         $ cp /mnt/c/Users/agrahame/Downloads/cloud-root.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
         $ sudo update-ca-certificates

         should see something like :

		 $ sudo update-ca-certificates
		 Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...
		 1 added, 0 removed; done.
		 Running hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...
		 done.                         

5. Need to import the 2 admiral certificates (Cardiff & Swansea) into both
windows and ubuntu 
      Pre-Req : get hold of admiral-CA-PRD-CDF01-CA.crt and
admiral-CA-PRD-SWA01-CA.crt (got mine on a USB drive from Ian)
      
     a) Import into Windows cert manager:
     browse to the area where you've copied the above admiral certs.
     right click on each cert > Install Certificate (opens Certificate Import
Wizard)
        - Store Location : Local Machine
        - Keep 'Automatically select the certificate store based on the type
          of certificate' - click Next, then Finish
        - Should see dialog - 'The Import was successful'

        - startup windows tool certlm
        - the above import automatically imported the admiral certs into : 
           Intermediate Certificate Authorities > Certificates
               as 'admiral-CA-PRD-CDF01-CA' and 'admiral-CA-PRD-SWA01-cA'
        - need to move these (drag'n'drop) to 
              Trusted Root Certification Authorities > Certificates

      b) import these 2 certificates into Ubuntu (same as Cloud Root cert
descibed above)


6. Java

    Windows:
    Get latest java 8 installer for windows & install

    Ubuntu:
    install openjdk v8 from repo


7. Install bluecoat cert into java trust-store (e.g install eclipse plugins)

   c:> 'C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_181\bin\keytool.exe' -importcert -keystore 'C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_181
\lib\security\cacerts' -file C:\Users\agrahame\Documents\cloud-cert.crt -alias bluecoat

   attempted to do this in ubuntu

   $ /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/keytool -importcert -keystore /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file /mnt/c/Users/agrahame/Documents/cloud-cert.crt -alias bluecoat

   but got following message :

	Enter keystore password:
	Certificate already exists in keystore under alias <debian:cloud-cert.pem>
	Do you still want to add it? [no]:
	Certificate was not added to keystore  
 
   so looks like its been done for ubuntu.



8. Docker
    Windows:
        installed docker for windows (ensure virtualisation/hyper-v configured)

        post install config

            general
                (if want to connect via ubuntu extension)
                check 'Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS'

            proxies
		check 'Manual Proxy configuration' 
                Set Web Server (HTTP) to the Proxy address (see above) and check the 'Use same for both' box.
                Added the following by-pass addresses: 
		   - pr-ghub.admiral.uk,assets.pr-ghub.admiral.uk

            kubernetes
		enable Kubernetes (default orchestrator : kubernetes)

    Ubuntu:
        install ubuntu docker cli :
        $ sudo apt install docker.io

        and hook it up to the docker for windows daemon.

        add the following to your bashrc profile:
           export DOCKER_HOST='tcp://localhost:2375'

        re-login to your ubuntu shell and test :

           $ docker run hello-world

           should execute successfully.....



9. Kubernetes
      Windows:
      Using the kubernetes install from docker for windows (see above)

      Ubuntu:
      install kubectl on your ubuntu extension
 
          kubectl config:
          create .kube directory under your home 
          softlink your windows kube config to this area : 
              $ ln -s /mnt/c/Users/agrahame/.kube/config .kube/config

          test:
		$ kubectl cluster-info
		Kubernetes master is running at https://localhost:6445
		KubeDNS is running at https://localhost:6445/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

		To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
