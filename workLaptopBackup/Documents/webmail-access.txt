I'm cannot access Outlook-Webmail when using my laptop which is connected to the Developer VLAN (i.e. not the corporate network).

I cannot gain access to webmail through Citrix, i.e. either :

   (1) via Atlas (tools drop-down-> Webmail) or 
   (2) using the 'Outlook Web Admin' application in the Citrix desktop.

Here is the error message I see when trying (1) in Chrome:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
	This site can’t be reached The connection was reset.

	Try:

	Checking the connection
	Checking the proxy and the firewall
	Running Windows Network Diagnostics

	ERR_CONNECTION_RESET
---------------------------------------------------------------------


However, I *can* access webmail when logged in on a desktop logged into the corporate network.

Please let me know what we can do to fix this issue.
