create a web socket in micronaut

copy event details onto general kafka topic

orchestrator subscribes to general topic, 
   gets messages from topic as they arrive
      for each message, write to mongodb (inc kafka offset)

      then send off to process:
          work out what response must be sent 
          send response back over all required web-sockets
