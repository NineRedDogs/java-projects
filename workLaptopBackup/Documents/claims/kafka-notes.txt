kafka

1. installed KafkaTool client - this allows us to connect to running kafka instances and view topics, etc

2. Start up spotify/kafka docker container
 
   $ docker run -p 2181:2181 -p 9092:9092 --env ADVERTISED_HOST=192.168.99.100 --env ADVERTISED_PORT=9092 spotify/kafka

   Note: ZooKeeper listens at 2181 and Kafka at 9092.

3.  Create a new topic with 2 partitions

    $ bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 2 --topic andy3_2

to view:

    $ bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
    andy3_2

    or can view new topic using kafka tool (UI)


4. Send some messages

Kafka comes with a command line client that will take input from a file or from standard input and send it out as messages to the Kafka cluster. By default, each line will be sent as a separate message.

Run the producer and then type a few messages into the console to send to the server.

$ bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test
This is a message
This is another message
