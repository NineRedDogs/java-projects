Quote notes

Old App
--------

The current production quote app uses Angular 6, and serves all products

Within the current app, a new folder providing the HH instaquote exists, where you can get a direct HH instaquote. 
   - HH instaquote is written in Angular 6



New App
-------

Plan is to release new app in this order:

    - HH agg 
    - Motor agg
    - HH/Motor direct

Its going to take 4 weeks to migrate the HH instaquote from A6 -> A7 (nov/dec 2019)

The new app is already deployed into a QA environement


------------------------

where are quotes saved ? e.g. if a customer wants to retrieve a previous quote
? how long do they last ? what houeskeeping goes on to clean them up ...

Amazon is a special kind of aggregator site, so a lot of the requirements currently set out for PCW will help deliver Amazon functionality. Amazon will provide a data set that will be sent to the pricing module. We may have to leverage some of the Instaquote approach, where default values are used for empty fields not populated by Amazon, in order to get a competitive quote.

New brand should be the area where the major changes are made. For example, a potential customer may be standing at the forecourt of a dealership. We create a quote journey where they can take a photo of their driving license and then a photo of a car's reg-plate. We'd have enough info to offer an immediate quote. This is just one example of a number of ways we'd be able to use modern techniques to make the customer's life simpler.

Partners may simply want to use a branded view of the existing quote flow, or use our quote solution in aggregator mode. Others may want to incorporate some of the modern flows we'd use in the new brand. There's a wide spectrum we might need to cover here, but it's likely we'd need to assess each partner with a case-by-case approach.




Admiral currently have an old and a new quote app. The old app (Angular v6) is currently in production. The new quote app (Angular v7) is currently being developed and will be rolled out in stages to production over the next few months.

Admiral have rolled Instaquote into the current production app for Direct Household quotes. An Instaquote for motor has also been developed.

Multibrand has been incorporated into the old app by adding 'if FORD' checks/guards directly into the angular code. This would prove cumbersome as more partners/brands are onboarded.


As iGO4 provide insurer hosted pricing, this would allow us to use the platform whilst retaining our pricing strategy. Data enrichment integrations are supported, which may allow a smaller data set to be collected from the customer.
