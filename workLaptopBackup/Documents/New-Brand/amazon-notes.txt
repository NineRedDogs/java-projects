Amazon
-----------------
August 2020 ??

Initially for HH, maybe Car 6/12 months later ???

Potentially need to cover Europe - or at least FRA/SPA/ITA/GER  - so this will introduce some complexities  ....


---------------



Essentially a PCW, amazon collect customer details, enrich using their DB and send on to insurance companies (IC). ICs then return quote and AMZ shows best 3 (?) along with customisable toggles. if user toggles value, new quotes are displayed.

_ we may have to provide multiple quotes up front (assuming they may toggle values) - this will avoid the need for AMZ to re-trigger the quote (to all ICs) - sounds excessive and may mean many different quotes each time.

customer chooses policy (from IC) and AMZ will own the payment process - using Amazon Pay

*** no customer payment info is held by Admiral at this point

we presume Amazon will then pass down a notification to indicate policy has been bought and cover begins - we can then create policy at admiral.


Use of AMZ-pay will cause problems, e.g. if an MTA is required, we do not have their payment details, we'd need to ask for them. This also applies to renewals (if no MTA/Claims have occurred in the year).

Renewals - kickback to AMZ - unsure how that will be defined.

Also Andrey mentioned a possible feature where customer gets chance to ask current insurer to price match the cheapest renewal quote.

What level of integration to billing is required - as AMZ-pay looks after the money

AMZ reduced questions will cause a problem for pricing - as less Qs mean less data -> means worse quote 

also AMZ are likely to change their Question set frequently, how can that be applied to GW/Ratabase.

Q: How do we currently quote with missing fields ? is it simply a case the quote isn't as personalised as desired, so will be slightly more generic and therefore not so competitive ?? or do we mandate all the fields currently ? if thats the case, we'll have a problem with AMZ's reduced data set.

*** Claims: Day 0, Vectus might be a possible solution as product is very similar to what it is today, however, when the product starts to change, which it will do frequently, then Vectus will no longer be a viable option.  Therefore it makes sense to begin with an alternative to avoid switching when the product changes.


Connected Homes - Andrey suggested that given Amazons role in smart devices around the home as well as their ability to sell IoT devices (and even get into the moarket) then there will be a likely link up of insurers/manufacturers/retails/suppliers to ensure homes are protected as much as possible.
  > This equally maps across to connected cars when motor insurance is included in the product.

Amazon are planning an Household insurance service. This service will be similar to the price comparison websites. However, there are two major differences with Amazon's service:
   - They will only use a small panel of the leading insurance providers in the UK. 
   - Amazon will own the payment journey using AmazonPay

Based on the success of this service, Amazon may choose to extend this service to cover Motor within 12 months.

Amazon will present a simple data collection page to the customer, where a limited data set will be gathered and further enriched with data they already have for that customer. Amazon will then pass the same data set to each of the insurance companies on the panel to provide quotes.

It is anticipated that Amazon will expect a series of quotes from each insurer. The range of quotes returned will be vary, dependent on the presence/absence of certain key points. This approach allows Amazon the ability to present a set of toggles on their quote results page. The customer may then tune their policy and see immediate quote updates without the need to get the insurers to requote.

The customer will then select their preferred quote, Amazon will take the payment using AmazonPay and send a notification (along with an updated data set) through to the chosen insurer.

The insurance company will then create the policy and cover will begin. Note, the insurer will not hold any customer payment details at this point.

We'd need to confirm if Amazon would then direct the customer to Admiral via a deep-link in order to view the policy details.


Mid-Term Adjustments

As described above, Amazon would own the payment journey for new policies. However, after policy creation, any modifications will be agreed between the customer and the insurer directly. In many cases, mid-term adjustments (MTA) result in a change of the cost of the policy. In these situations, the insurer would need access to the customer's payment details, or at the very least inform Amazon of the change, so they can revise any ongoing billing payments.

Renewals

When the policy cover is due to end, both Amazon and the insurer will send the customer a renewal reminder. If the customer chooses to renew directly with the insurer, then it's likely that the insurer will need customer payment details (unless an MTA/claim has been made). 

However, the customer may prefer to re-evaluate the prices offered by the Amazon service. In which case they would essentially repeat the process where the policy was created, with some of the data collected could be pre-populated based on data already provided.

It's possible that should the current insurer's renewal quote be higher than a competitor's, Amazon may provide a mechanism to allow the customer to give the current insurer the option to price match. This is in-keeping with the fundamental Amazon policy of providing their customers with the best serive possible.

It's likely that each insurer may have to provide some sort of kickback to Amazon for each renewal, although we'd need to confirm how this might be achieved.

We'd need to assess the data set provided by Amazon, to determine if this gives us the opportunity to make best use of our pricing model. i.e. the reduced data we get (compared with the current quote data set) may not allow us to deliver the most competitive quote.

Also, Amazon are likely to change their question set frequently, we'd need to ensure that our Policy/Pricing solutions are capable of handling such changes in a timely manner.

Claims:
For day 0, Vectus may be able to service the claims needs for Amazon policies. This is because the product we understand Amazon require is very similar to what we have today, However, as is expected, the product starts to change, Vectus will no longer be a viable option. Therefore it makes sense to begin with an suitable alternative to avoid switching mid-course.

Connected Homes:
Given Amazon's lead role in providing smart devices (Amazon Echo, Ring, etc) around the home, as well as their ability to sell a wide range of Home security/IoT devices, then it follows that there may be a movement to link up insurers/manufacturers/retails/suppliers to ensure homes are protected as much as possible. This approach may have a big impact on the types of cover offered in the future.

Being part of Amazon's insurance story at the outset will provide Admiral critical insight into how the market is likely to develop into a digital future.

Note that the impact of connected homes/devices to Household insurance can also be projected to Motor cover and connected cars when the time comes to consider motor.
